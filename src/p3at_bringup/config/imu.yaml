phidgets_spatial:
  ros__parameters:
    # serial: -1
    frame_id: imu_link
    use_orientation: true # Use the phidget spatials onboard orientation estimation; false for older version
    spatial_algorithm: imu

    # ahrs_acceleration_threshold: 0.1 # Parameter for AHRS orientation estimation; Just used if use_orientation is set to true.
    # ahrs_mag_time: 0.1 # Parameter for AHRS orientation estimation; Just used if use_orientation is set to true.
    # ahrs_accel_time: 0.1 # Parameter for AHRS orientation estimation; Just used if use_orientation is set to true.
    # ahrs_bias_time: 0.1 # Parameter for AHRS orientation estimation; Just used if use_orientation is set to true.
    # algorithm_magnetometer_gain: 0.1 # Gain of magnetometer in orientation estimation algorithm; Just used if use_orientation is set to true. Defaults to 0.005
    # heating_enabled: false # Use the internal heating element; Just available on MOT0109 onwards. Do not set this parameter for older versions.
    # linear_acceleration_stdev: 280.0 # The standard deviation to use for the linear acceleration when publishing the message. Defaults to 280 ug.
    # angular_velocity_stdev: 0.095  # The standard deviation to use for the angular velocity when publishing the message. Defaults to 0.095 deg/s.
    # magnetic_field_stdev: 1.1 # The standard deviation to use for the magnetic field when publishing the message. Defaults to 1.1 milligauss.
    # time_resynchronization_interval_ms: 5000 # The number of milliseconds to wait between resynchronizing the time on the Phidgets spatial with the local time. Larger values have less "jumps", but will have more timestamp drift. Setting this to 0 disables resynchronization. Defaults to 5000 ms.
    # data_interval_ms: 8 # The number of milliseconds between acquisitions of data on the device (allowed values are dependent on the device). Defaults to 8 ms.
    # callback_delta_epsilon_ms: 1 # The number of milliseconds epsilon allowed between callbacks when attempting to resynchronize the time. If this is set to 1, then a difference of data_interval_ms plus or minus 1 millisecond will be considered viable for resynchronization. Higher values give the code more leeway to resynchronize, at the cost of potentially getting bad resynchronizations sometimes. Lower values can give better results, but can also result in never resynchronizing. Must be less than data_interval_ms. Defaults to 1 ms.
    # publish_rate: 0.0 # How often the driver will publish data on the ROS topic. If 0 (the default), it will publish every time there is an update from the device (so at the data_interval_ms). If positive, it will publish the data at that rate regardless of the acquisition interval.
